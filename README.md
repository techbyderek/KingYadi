# 👋 Hi!

I'm *Derek*, I would like to assist you in any coding gibberish you need ꩜.


Outside of coding, you'll find me playing videogames (*I love story games*), hitting the gym or watching movies. I also enjoy worshiping *Jesus* and sharing gaming and tech-related content on social media. (*check out my socials*;) ⚠︎

# Fun Facts:
 - I like to stream. ツ
 - I have two dogs, Julieta and Hanzo. ੯·̀͡⬮
 - I want more tattoos even though I have a lot of them.
 - Everyone mostly knows me by '𝓎𝒶𝒹𝒾'.

# Free jokes: 😎
   “When I wrote this code, only God and I understood what I did. Now only God knows.” ✞
